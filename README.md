# DevOps & Cloud Portfolio
A curated set of hands-on projects showcasing my work across AWS, Azure, and GCP with a strong focus on Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC, CI/CD, and secure app platforms (FastAPI, JWT, WIF).


## Highlights
* Multi-cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP (managed K8s: EKS/AKS/GKE)

* GitOps-first: Helm/Kustomize + Argo CD, repeatable environments

* IaC: Terraform modules with environment overlays

* Secure app platforms: JWT auth, secrets, least-privilege access

* Pipelines: GitHub Actions & Azure Pipelines for build/deploy

* Data: BigQuery analytics with notebooks and Python tooling

## Tech Stack

* Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP

* Kubernetes: AKS, GKE (plus OpenShift concepts where relevant)

* GitOps: Argo CD, Helm, Kustomize

* IaC: Terraform (+ modules & environment overlays)

* App: Python, FastAPI, JWT

* Pipelines: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps

* Data: BigQuery, Jupyter Notebooks
